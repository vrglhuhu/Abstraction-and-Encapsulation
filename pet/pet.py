# Vergel, Chean Bernard Villanueva
# Pet Class

# Write a class named Pet

    # _ _name (for the name of a pet)
    # _ _animal_type (for the type of animal that a pet is. Example values are ‘Dog’, ‘Cat’, and ‘Bird’)
    # _ _age (for the pet’s age)
    # The Pet class should have an _ _init_ _ method that creates these attributes. It should also have the following methods:

    # Set_name() This method assigns a value to the _ _name field.

    # Set_animal_type() This method assigns a value to the _ _animal_type field.

    # Set_age() This method assigns a value to the _ _age field.

    # Get_name() This method returns the value of the _ _ name field.

    # get_animal_type() This method returns the value of the _ _animal_type field

    # get_age() This method returns the value of the _ _age field.
