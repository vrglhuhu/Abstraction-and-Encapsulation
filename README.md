_I am Chean Bernard V. Vergel.  I am 18 years old and currently I am a first year college student taking my Bachelors' degree in Computer Engineering at Polytechnic University of the Philippines.  I believe that technology is something that has completely changed the way we live today and I am excited to be part of this ever-evolving world.  A famous quote I always like to keep in mind is "The only way to predict the future is to create it." - Abraham Lincoln._

### **Introduction**
>_Abstraction & Encapsulation is now open! Three Python programs are included in this repository: Fan Getter & Setter, Car Tester, and Pet Creator. Most of the programs offered provide unique capabilities and allow users to interact with virtual things. In the next part, we will go through the specifics of these programs._

### **PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED**
> Python

### **Fan Status Indicator.**
_This Fan Status indicator has a setter and getter function for retrieving and modifying its attributes. Speed, radius, color, and power are examples of these properties._

_The Carr Speed Indicator program allows users to construct and assess their dream autos. It uses object-oriented programming techniques and has acceleration and braking capabilities._
